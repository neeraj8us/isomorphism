Code in java file Graph.java contains the method to generate the signature of the graph which is invarient for all isomorphic graph.
i.e if the two graphs are isomorphic, their signature  will be exactly same.

To Build execute the command.
$ ./gradlew build

To run. java -cp .:build/lib/*.jar com.neer.Main

it generates the random graphs for specific number of vertices and edges and then generates the isomorphic graphs of the random graphs to test correctness of algorithms.
